fastdropout
===========
Loss functions for fast dropout/dropout and baselines like softmax, and logistic regressions
They are described in the readme file in the respective folders.
To get the idea behind them, see the fast dropout paper on my website at stanford.edu/~sidaw

If you have minFunc, you can try running linear_setup.m
The example_data loaded are vectors from the atheism vs. christian newsgroup task.

Some loss functions are adpated from PMTK

May 28, 2013

I am sorry it took me so long to put this up, all of this remains largely unchanged from almost a year ago.
I wanted to clean the code up and do a demo that is independent of PMTK and most other stuff,
but wanting to clean code only lead to endless procratination.
So I decided today I would just release the loss functions immediately in the raw form as used,
and put up a rather simple demo that still depends on minfunc.
